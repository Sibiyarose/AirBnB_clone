# AirBnB clone project 

The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

You wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## The command line interpreter

A command line interpreter is any program that allows the entering of commands and then executes those commands to the operating system. They work on text-based interfaces where the users can type their requests and queries as required and obtain the desired results. In comparison to this, graphical user interfaces contain all the information in visual form where icons, windows etc. can be used to access and manipulate data.

#### Examples
* Bourne shell sh
* Almquist shell (ash)
* Debian Almquist shell (dash)
* Bash (Unix shell) bash
* KornShell ksh
* Z shell zsh
* C shell csh
* TENEX C shell tcsh
* Ch shell ch
* Emacs shell eshell
* Friendly interactive shell fish
* PowerShell pwsh
* rc shell rc, a shell for Plan 9 from Bell Labs and Unix
* Stand-alone shell sash
